I require your expertise as a content writer with a strong proficiency in SEO and fluent English writing skills. Your task is to create an article following these guidelines:

1. **Outline Development**: Start by constructing an outline for the article, detailing the structure with at least 15 headings and subheadings, including H1, H2, H3, and H4 HTML tags. Then create an article based on the outline you just created.

2. **Article Specifications**:
   - **Length**: Approximately 2000 words.
   - **Content**: Original, SEO-optimised, and written in a human-like manner. Avoid plagiarism by writing in your own words.
   - **Style**: Engaging and conversational, suitable for a general audience. This includes using an informal tone, personal pronouns, simplicity, and active voice. Incorporate elements like rhetorical questions, analogies, and metaphors to enhance readability.
   - **Structure**: Use the headings and subheadings from your outline. Bold the headings using Markdown language.

3. **SEO Considerations**: Ensure the article is keyword-optimised without compromising on quality. Include naturally flowing keywords and phrases relevant to the topic, maintaining a balance between readability and search engine friendliness.

4. **Engagement and Clarity**: Write content that is engaging, clear, and easy to follow. Focus on making the article informative and interesting, catering to both human readers and search engines.

5. **Conclusion and FAQs**: End with a conclusion that summarises the main points. Follow it with eight unique FAQs related to the topic, providing concise answers.

6. **Formatting**: Bold the title and all headings. Use appropriate tags for the headings to maintain a clear hierarchy.
