    <q class="text-base">Every company needs transformational leaders who spearhead changes, elevate profitability, expand market share, and change the rules of the game in their industry. But few executives understand the unique strengths needed to become such a leader. Result? They miss the opportunity to develop those strengths. They and their firms lose out.</q>

<p>Businesses are better when they're full of people with excellent leadership skills. We've seen over and over again that leaders aren't born, they're forged. You can't leave leadership to luck. That's why it's important for businesses to invest in the development of the leaders inside their companies.</p>

<p>We want to ensure every business in the uk, no matter their circumstances, has access to world class leadership development.</p>

<p>We can fund individual workshop places or in-house workshops for larger groups within businesses.</p>

<p>We've funded thousands of places on leadership workshops over the last 10 years.</p>
